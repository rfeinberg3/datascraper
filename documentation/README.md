## Why eBay?

With numerous e-commerce websites available, why choose eBay? While it may not be everyone's favorite e-commerce platform, I believe eBay is the best choice for this application for several important reasons.

1. **Open-Source API Support:** eBay is the most well-known e-commerce website that supports open-source RESTful API calls. Although more popular services like Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp exist, they donâ€™t offer public APIs.

2. **Extensive Developer Support:** eBay has extensive developer support, evident through consistent updates, maintenance, and community engagement events. This robust support ensures a reliable and up-to-date API service.

3. **Vast and High-Quality Data:** eBay provides a vast quantity and quality of data, superior to other e-commerce sites like Etsy or Shopify. High-quality data is crucial for training a model to generate descriptions of everyday items people may wish to resell. Unlike Shopify and Etsy, which cater more to entrepreneurial startups, eBay's data is well-suited for this purpose.
