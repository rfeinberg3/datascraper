With starlight technology, this series camera provides a better image effect in the condition of low illuminance.\nPlay&Play\nOriginal Dahua Security Home CCTV System\n Functions\n Siren and Light Active Deterrence\nDahua siren and light active deterrence network camera supports thelight alarm and voice alarm when perimeter event occurs, to realize thedeterrence and effective intervention. The camera is built in multiplevoices for selection, and supports customized voice importing.\n SMD 4.0\nDahua Smart Motion Detection technology works with intelligentalgorithms to classify targets that trigger motion detection alarms. Itfilters out objects that are not targets, such as small and large animals,to avoid triggering false alarms. With an AI NVR, Quick Pick technologybecomes available, allowing you to easily search for and pick out humanand vehicle targets from SMD event videos, prioritizing the highestmatches. \n Smart Dual Light\nDahua Smart Dual Light technology adopts smart algorithm to detecttargets. Usually, the IR illuminator is on at night; when the targetappears in the monitoring area, the white light is on, and the camerarecords the full-color video and information of key events. That is, thecamera links snapshot and video with full-color image. When the targetis out of the monitoring area, the white light is off and the IR illuminatoris on, which reduces light pollution efficiently.\n  Perimeter Protection\nWith deep learning algorithm, Dahua Perimeter Protection technologycan recognize human and vehicle accurately. In restricted area (suchas pedestrian area and vehicle area), the false alarms of intelligentdetection based on target type (such as tripwire, intrusion) are largelyreduced. \n Full-color\nWith high-performance sensor and large aperture lens, Dahua Full-colortechnology can display clear colorful image in the environment of ultralow illuminance. With this photosensitivity technology, the camera cancapture more available light, and display more colorful image details\n Smart H.265+ & Smart H.264+\nWith advanced scene-adaptive rate control algorithm, Dahua smartencoding technology realizes the higher encoding efficiency than H.265and H.264, provides high-quality video, and reduces the cost of storageand transmission\n Cyber Security\nDahua network cameras employ a series of security technologies,including security authentication and authorization, access controlprotocols, trusted protection, encrypted transmission and encryptedstorage. These technologies improve the camera's defense againstexternal cyber threats and prevent malicious programs fromcompromising the device.\n Protection (IP67, Wide Voltage)\nIP67: The camera passes a series of strict test on dust and soak. It has dust-proof function, and the enclosure can work normally after soakingin 1 m deep water for 30 minutes.Wide voltage: The camera allows \u00b130% (for some power supplies)input voltage tolerance (wide voltage range), and it is widely applied tooutdoor environment with instable voltage.\n  Easy for using\nAbout Us:\n1.
